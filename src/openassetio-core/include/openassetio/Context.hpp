 * The Context object is used to convey information about the calling
 * environment to a @ref manager.
 *
 * It holds additional information about the @ref host that may be
 * useful to the @ref manager. Optionally, it holds arbitrary, opaque
 * (to the host), serializable manager state, which can be used by the
 * manager plugin to tie together related calls.
 *
 * A Manager will also use this information to ensure it presents the
 * correct UI, or behavior.
 *
 * The Context is passed to many calls in this API, and it may, or may
 * not need to be used directly.
 *
 * @warning Contexts should never be directly constructed. Hosts should
 * use @fqref{hostApi.Manager.createContext} "createContext" or
 * @fqref{hostApi.Manager.createChildContext} "createChildContext". A
 * Manager implementation should never need to create a context of it's
 * own, one will always be supplied through the ManagerInterface entry
 * points.
